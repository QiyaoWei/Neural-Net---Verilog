# Neural-Net---Verilog
A simplified implementation of a hand-written digit recognition neural network, built from scratch in Verilog. Data is taken from the MNIST database

Simulation in softwares such as ModelSim is enabled through the .do file, but executing the .v file in softwares such as Quartus requires .mif files to contain pixel values of hand-written digit images
